My Schoolwork
I need help with my school work as Repl.it is being really stupid. One minute, "Try:" and "Except:" work. Then the next minute "Except:" says it's invalid syntax. I quit Repl to be here.
My code is here solely to be a reference for syntax errors that come up during my project. I use Google searches which lead me to stackoverflow forums which in turn lead me to solutions to my syntax problems.
I'm hoping to do python code that actually shows me what I'm doing wrong and how I can fix it. I want to learn the syntax by hands-on problem solving. Any additions would be appreciated.
If you know, please tell me.
If you don't know then join me in learning.
